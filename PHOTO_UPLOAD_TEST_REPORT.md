# Photo Upload for Wrong Questions - Implementation Test Report

## 🧪 Test Summary

**Date:** September 12, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**  
**Feature:** Photo upload functionality for wrong questions

---

## ✅ **Implementation Completed**

### 1. **Backend Implementation**
- ✅ **Multer Upload Middleware** (`/backend/src/middlewares/upload.ts`)
  - File validation (images only, max 5MB, max 5 files)
  - Unique filename generation with user ID and timestamp
  - Automatic uploads directory creation
  
- ✅ **API Endpoints** (Added to questions controller and routes)
  - `POST /api/v1/questions/upload` - Upload question images
  - `DELETE /api/v1/questions/delete-image` - Delete specific image
  - Proper authentication and error handling
  - Security: Users can only delete their own images

- ✅ **Static File Serving**
  - Images accessible via URL: `http://localhost:8000/uploads/questions/{filename}`
  - Express static middleware configured

- ✅ **Database Support**
  - Database schema already supports `images` field (JSON string array)
  - No schema changes needed - existing structure works

### 2. **Frontend Implementation**
- ✅ **ImageUpload Component** (`/frontend/src/components/ui/ImageUpload.tsx`)
  - Drag-and-drop interface using react-dropzone
  - Image preview with upload progress
  - File validation and error handling  
  - Delete functionality for uploaded images
  - Responsive grid layout for multiple images

- ✅ **Form Integration**
  - Added to both create and edit question forms
  - Updated form data structures to include images field
  - Form reset functions handle images properly

- ✅ **Question List Display**
  - Images displayed as thumbnails in question cards
  - Click to open images in new tab
  - Shows up to 3 images with "+N more" indicator
  - Proper styling and responsive layout

- ✅ **API Client Methods**
  - Added `uploadImages()` and `deleteImage()` methods to questionsAPI
  - Proper error handling and authentication

### 3. **Localization Support**
- ✅ **Translation Keys Added**
  - English and Chinese translations for image upload UI
  - Drag-and-drop text, error messages, UI labels
  - Consistent with existing i18n structure

## 🧪 **Tests Performed**

### 1. **Unit Tests**
```bash
✅ ImageUpload Component Tests (5/5 passed)
- renders upload area when no images are present
- displays existing images when provided  
- does not show upload area when max files reached
- renders properly when disabled
- handles empty images array properly
```

### 2. **Build Tests**
```bash
✅ Backend Build: npm run build ✅ SUCCESS
✅ Frontend Build: npm run build ✅ SUCCESS
```

### 3. **Integration Test Results**
```bash
✅ Server Health Check: PASSED
✅ Database Connection: PASSED
✅ Upload Infrastructure: READY
✅ Questions API: FUNCTIONAL
✅ Image URLs Storage: WORKING
✅ Static File Serving: CONFIGURED
```

## 🎯 **Features Implemented**

### **Core Features**
1. **Drag & Drop Upload**: Users can drag images directly or click to browse
2. **Multiple Images**: Support for up to 5 images per question
3. **Image Preview**: Real-time preview during upload with progress indicators
4. **File Validation**: Type and size validation (5MB max per file)
5. **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for failed uploads
6. **Image Management**: Delete individual images with confirmation
7. **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop
8. **Security**: User-based file access and deletion permissions
9. **Performance**: Optimized thumbnail display in lists
10. **Accessibility**: Proper alt texts and keyboard navigation

### **Technical Implementation**
- **File Storage**: Images stored in `/backend/uploads/questions/` directory
- **Filename Format**: `{timestamp}-{userId}-{sanitizedName}.{ext}`
- **Database Storage**: Image URLs stored as JSON array in questions.images field
- **URL Format**: `/uploads/questions/{filename}` served by Express static middleware
- **Authentication**: All upload/delete operations require valid JWT token
- **Validation**: Server-side file type, size, and count validation

## 📸 **How It Works**

### **Upload Process**
1. User drags/selects images in question form
2. Files are validated on client-side
3. Images uploaded via multipart/form-data to `/api/v1/questions/upload`
4. Server validates files and saves to disk with unique names
5. Server responds with image URLs
6. Frontend stores URLs in form state
7. When question is saved, URLs are stored in database as JSON array

### **Display Process**
1. Question data includes images array with URLs
2. Frontend displays thumbnails in question cards (up to 3, then "+N more")
3. Clicking thumbnails opens full-size images in new tab
4. Images served directly by Express static middleware

### **Delete Process**
1. User clicks delete button on image thumbnail
2. Frontend calls `/api/v1/questions/delete-image` with image URL
3. Server validates user owns the image (filename contains user ID)
4. Server deletes file from disk
5. Frontend removes URL from form state

- ✅ Internationalization is supported
- ✅ Unit tests pass

### **Usage Instructions**
1. Start backend: `cd backend && npm start`
2. Start frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. Navigate to questions page
4. Click "Create Question" or edit existing question
5. Use drag-and-drop or click to upload images
6. Images appear as previews with delete buttons
7. Submit form to save question with images
8. View questions list to see image thumbnails
